```

# Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source xssenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: xssenv\Scripts\activate
```
‚Ä¢	Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

	‚Ä¢	Required libraries:

üõ†Ô∏è Running the Application

1. Start the Backend Server

In the project directory, run the Flask server:
```bash
python backend/app.py
```

This will start the backend server at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

2. Start the Frontend

To run the frontend, use Python‚Äôs HTTP server to serve the HTML files:

# Navigate to the frontend folder
```bash
cd frontend
```

# Start the server
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

The frontend will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
